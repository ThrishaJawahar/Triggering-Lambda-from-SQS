- Lambda is triggered to process the message.
- The result is logged, and errors are sent to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).

## Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured
- IAM role with the following permissions:
  - SQS
  - Lambda
  - CloudWatch

## Setup
1. Create an SQS Queue.
2. Deploy the Lambda function using the provided code.
